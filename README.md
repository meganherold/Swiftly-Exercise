# Swiftly-Exercise

This is my solution for the [Swiftly iOS coding exercise](https://github.com/Swiftly-Systems/code-exercise-ios) - an iOS app displaying grocery items currently on "Manager Special".

## Usage
Clone and run on a simulator or device using Xcode. No Cocoa-pods or Carthage Update necessary!

## Technology
* Written in Swift 5
* 100% programmatic layout with `UIKit` - no storyboards or nibs
* Models using `Codable`
* Basic model initialization unit tests

## Features
* Portrait mode only
* Try it on an iPad!
* Try it in dark mode and light mode!
* Try it with your wifi off (you'll get an error)

## What I would add next
* A responsive layout solution for when the images and text are too small
* Pull-to-refresh
* UI Tests
